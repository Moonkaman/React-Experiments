# Starwars Redux

I made this project to help me understand Redux best practices better and also to help me see what a bigger Redux project might look like and how everything fits together. It is deployed on netlify at this link [https://starwars-redux.netlify.com/](https://starwars-redux.netlify.com/)

This project was made using these dependencies:

- React
- Redux
- React-Bootstrap
- Emotion
- React Router
- React-Redux

If you want to run the project locally these are the steps you would need to take.

1.  Fork / Clone the repository down to your local machine.
2.  CD into the cloned directory and `yarn install`
3.  Lastly just `yarn start`
